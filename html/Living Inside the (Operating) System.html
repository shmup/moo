      This essay is an attempt to describe and explain the way that an unusual
      (but by no means anomalous) culture has developed under the aegis of
      PMC-MOO, a text-based virtual-reality program that runs on a networked
      Unix workstation. It is also an attempt to describe the scholarly and
      pedagogical trajectory of this program, by identifying the conceptual
      coordinates of its origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      MOOs belong to a class of programs known as MUDs, and MUDs are ably
      defined by Pavel Curtis, the inventor of MOOs, as follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      A MUD (Multi-User Dungeon or, sometimes, Multi-User Dimension) is a
      network-accessible, multi-participant, user-extensible virtual reality
      whose user interface is entirely textual. Participants (usually called
      players) have the appearance of being situated in an
      artificially-constructed place that also contains those other players who
      are connected at the same time. Players can communicate easily with each
      other in real time.<a name="4" href="#four">[4]</a> This virtual gathering
      place has many of the social attributes of other places, and many of the
      usual social mechanisms operate there. Certain attributes of this virtual
      place, however, tend to have significant effects on social phenomena,
      leading to new mechanisms and modes of behavior not usually seen `IRL' (in
      real life).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I will substantially disagree with that last point in the course of this
      essay, but suffice it to say, for now, that in practical terms, the
      experience of participating in a MOO is that one sits at a keyboard, in
      front of a screen, and projects oneself over a global computer network
      into an entirely textual world, and into an entirely virtual community.
      Community is generally a function of shared location, shared interests,
      and sometimes shared government and shared property: in order to deserve
      the name, a community needs more than one, though not necessarily all, of
      those attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of PMC-MOO, the community which I will discuss here, all those
      attributes are present in some sense or in some measure. However, it would
      be a mistake to see this community, or the larger archipelago civilization
      of MOOs to which it belongs, as entirely communitarian, or as entirely
      self- determining. Rather, I will argue, PMC-MOO and MOOs in general take
      shape under twin forces not unlike fate and free will, where free will is
      what we always have understood it to be, but where the role of fate is
      played by the operating system in which the MOO is embedded. The aporia in
      this analogy, and it is an important one for my argument, is that unlike
      transcendental fate, computer operating systems are historically and
      culturally determined.
    </p>
    <h3>Unix and Monopoly Capital:</h3>
    <p>
      To understand the cultural moment that is expressed in the operating
      system in question, Unix, and to understand the effects of Unix on the
      formation of MOO code and MOO culture, we must isolate and understand a
      few concepts and a little history as well. For our purposes, the concepts
      that matter most are expressed in their most basic form in the Unix
      filesystem, as hierarchy, user groups, and ownership. The Unix filesystem
      is hierarchical in its organization, and the particular kind of hierarchy
      is, in essence, dendritic: file systems have a tree- like structure, with
      a "root" directory containing files and other directories, or branches, of
      the filesystem, which in turn can contain other files and directories. In
      Unix, every file (and indeed, every process) has an individual owner, and
      the hierarchy of owners explicitly mirrors the hierarchy of the filesystem
      itself, with the superuser of all users and user groups called "root."
      Every individual user, then, belongs to one or more user groups, and the
      permission to read, write, delete, search, or execute a particular file is
      precisely defined for owner, group, and other. It is difficult to
      exaggerate the importance of these basic concepts in Unix: in fact, the
      filesystem organization is itself a kind of first cause for Unix, inasmuch
      as its origins lie in the dim prehistory of Unix, in Multics. Multics was
      a multi-user mainframe operating system developed jointly in the late
      1960s by Bell Labs, MIT, and General Electric and intended to permit
      time-sharing on large, expensive, centralized computer resources. Not
      surprisingly, the developers of Multics, and after them, the developers of
      Unix, reasoned that if an operating system will permit many users to look
      at and manipulate the same files at the same time, it is necessary to
      establish which users are associated with which files, and what
      permissions are granted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      AT&amp;T; began developing Multics in 1964,<a name="5" href="#five"
        >[5]</a
      >
      eight years after the 1956 Consent Decree which settled the last
      anti-trust suit against the company. Although the 1956 decision said
      nothing about software (because the concept wasn't available), AT&amp;T;
      interpreted the decision cautiously, and when Unix came along, the company
      decided to distribute its operating system on non-profit terms-- licensed
      at very low cost to universities, and priced prohibitively high for
      commercial clients, expressly so as to avoid developing a software
      business. In fact, what was distributed was the source code, which meant
      that university researchers could tinker with the system, offer
      improvements, and make modifications to suit their needs. However, since
      Bell Labs was distributing the software at or near cost, it wasn't
      particularly interested in providing user support. This fostered two
      things--a kind of priesthood of the code, manifested as a hierarchy of
      arcane knowledge about the complex and often cryptically documented
      system, and also a self-supporting user community, which became incarnate
      in the late 1970s and early 1980s as Usenet. Usenet was (and is) an
      independent mail network that allowed users to post questions and receive
      answers about specific features of Unix, or about applications that run
      under Unix. Usenet still flourishes, and still fulfills its original
      function, but it has expanded to include discussion of many topics that
      have nothing to do with operating systems, and it has become an
      asynchronous culture in its own right.<a name="6" href="#six">[6]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the largest context, then, Unix developed as a byproduct of research at
      a corporate laboratory, under the constraints imposed by anti-trust
      legislation, which helped to force it out of the channels in which
      proprietary inventions usually travel in a capitalist economy, and into
      the freely exchanged economy of academic research and invention. It should
      also be noted, though, that Bell Labs itself, at least in its research
      divisions, was and may still be a more fertile environment for
      technological creativity than many universities. The nature of pure
      research is that one doesn't know what will ultimately "pay off":
      therefore, it's necessary to invest in a diversified portfolio of research
      activities. According to Samuel P. Morgan, a member of the Bell labs
      Research Area beginning in 1947 and, during the early seventies, Director
      of the Computing Science Research Center,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      If there aren't a certain number of things taken up in the organization
      every year that don't work out, we're not being sufficiently aggressive,
      or innovative, or we are not gambling enough. . . . We work on
      percentages, and of course this is true throughout any research
      organization. We've got to have a certain number of failures. . . .<a
        name="7"
        href="#seven"
        >[7]</a
      >
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In fact, it is only a very large accumulation of wealth that makes it
      practical to gamble in this way, investing resources in doing research
      with no immediately obvious economic benefit. Moreover, the kind of
      research environment that produces these unpredictable benefits,
      especially in the area of computer hardware and software, has proven to be
      decentralized and voluntaristic. This is true even outside of the area of
      pure research, in the application of computer technology to business
      operations. According to V.M. Wolontis, Executive Director of the
      Operations Research Division at Bell labs during the early days of Unix,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Things in the computer applications field have developed because
      individual people at the working level have had ideas and have pursued
      them. Things have grown from the working level up, rather than by some
      major management figure sitting at his desk saying this shall be
      computerized, and bingo, a hundred people march in the direction of
      computerizing a big segment of the operation. There is a tendency for the
      computer as a tool to inject itself into the operation through the efforts
      of interested specialists who enjoy it and who want to make the
      contribution. Management approval is a subsequent step.<a
        name="8"
        href="#eight"
        >[8]</a
      >
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Although the kind of intellectual freedom to "play around" with problems
      and "contribute" solutions does depend on the kind of corporate security
      that comes only under the auspices of monopoly capital or government,
      individual projects still have to at least attempt to justify themselves
      with respect to some cost- benefit analysis, however putative: even when
      gambling, there are better and worse bets. Within the atmosphere of free
      invention, the time-sharing and resource-coupling nature of the Unix
      operating system was driven, paradoxically, by the prohibitive cost of
      mainframes, which dictated that each machine should have more than one
      user and, if possible, more than one user at a time. One of the original
      developers of Unix recalls that, when their group faced the decline of
      Multics, their requests for new computer equipment on which to write a new
      operating system were repeatedly rebuffed: "[I]t is perfectly obvious in
      retrospect (and should have been at the time) that we were asking the Labs
      to spend too much money on too few people with too vague a plan."<a
        name="9"
        href="#nine"
        >[9]</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that the operating system developed in the context of a corporate
      entity whose primary business was telecommunications, and whose primary
      interests were communications and connectivity, helped to enshrine within
      it the principles of modularity and interoperability. But at another
      level, one extremely relevant to the effects that Unix has had in the
      world, communication was a motivating factor in the design of this
      operating system:
    </p>

      The fact that the software these researchers produced was easy to modify,
      good at accepting instructions from remote users, and unsupported by its
      corporate parent, helped to ensure that one of the first uses to which it
      would be put, once it reached the outside world, was the networking of
      users into a community, originally a user-support community, but later
      something much more diverse.

      If we consider all these factors together, the paradoxes are striking. On
      the one hand, as a mental representation of the universe of information,
      Unix is deeply indebted to culturally determined notions such as private
      property, class membership, and hierarchies of power and effectivity. Most
      of these ideas are older than the modern Western culture that produced
      Unix, but the constellation of cultural elements gathered together in
      Unix's basic operating principles seems particularly Western and
      capitalist--not surprisingly, given that its creators were human
      extensions of one of the largest accumulations of capital in the Western
      world. On the other hand, this tool, shaped though it was by the notions
      of ownership and exclusivity, spawned a culture of cooperation, of
      homemade code, of user-contributed modifications and improvements (viz.
      the canonical /contrib/bin in Unix filesystems, where user-contributed
      programs are stored) --in short, of "fellowship." And finally, in some
      sense it is true, as Guattari suggests, that the entire assemblage of
      causes for Unix is an instance of machines speaking to machines, or
      needing to speak to machines, with humans as the midwife at this
      precarious and unlikely birth. In order to explicate this paradox, though,
      it might help us to consider a set of relevant insights from an early and
      expert analyst of capitalism, Karl Marx.
    </p>
    <h3>MOOs and Marx:</h3>
    <p>
      In writing about the French Revolution, Karl Marx observed that the civil
      [or bourgeois] society that was established for the first time by that
      revolution understands itself to be based on the "natural and
      imprescriptible rights" declared in the Constitution of 1793, namely
      "equality, liberty, security, property." According to that document,
      liberty "consists in the right to do anything which does not harm others;"
      the right of property "is the right vested in every citizen to enjoy and
      dispose of his goods, his revenues, the fruit of his labour and of his
      industry according to his will;" equality "consists in the fact that the
      same law applies to all, whether that law protects or punishes;" and
      security "consists in the protection which society offers to each of its
      members for the preservation of his person, his rights, and his property."
      It is worth pointing out that each of these rights has its equivalent in
      the world of Unix: users, the equivalent of citizens, are permitted
      actions which do not harm the data of others--unless those others have, of
      their own free will, disposed of that data so that permission is granted
      to others to overwrite it; the same rights apply to all (within a given
      user class, at least. All bets are off when it comes to root--but even in
      Enlightenment democracies, equality has always been the most problematic
      right, especially when it comes to conflicts of interest between an
      individual and the state. . .and arguably, since all rights are granted,
      ultimately, by root, root is the Unix equivalent of the State). Security,
      in Unix terms, is called exactly the same thing, and providing systems
      security, so as to protect the accumulated labor of legitimate users, is
      considered the paramount duty of the Unix systems administrator.<a

    </p>
    <p>
      Marx finds these "so-called rights of man" to be the defining
      characteristics of bourgeois society because none of them
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      goes beyond the egoistic man, beyond man as a member of civil society, as
      man separated from life in the community and withdrawn into himself, into
      his private interest and his private arbitrary will. These rights are far
      from conceiving man as a species-being. They see, rather, the life of the
      species itself, society, as a frame external to individuals, as a
      limitation of their original independence. The only bond that keeps men
      together is natural necessity, need and private interest, the preservation
      of property and of their egoistic person.<a name="12" href="#twelve"
        >[12]</a
      >
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Because I am arguing that the MOO draws out and enacts some of the
      contradictions inherent not only in Unix and Unix culture, but also in
      capitalism and Western culture, it is important to stop here and
      concentrate for a moment on the term that Marx opposes to bourgeois
      monadic egotism. Marx defines "species- being" elsewhere, in manuscripts
      written during the same period, in terms that cast an interesting light on
      my earlier assertion that Unix, and in its own turn, the MOO, are mental
      representations of a world:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      His creation, in practice, of an objective world, his working upon
      inorganic nature, is the proof that man is a conscious species-being, that
      is a being which is related to the species as its own essence or to itself
      as a species being. To be sure, animals also produce. They build
      themselves nests, dwelling places, as the bees, beavers, ants, etc. do.
      But the animal produces what it needs directly for itself or its young. It
      produces one-sidedly, while man produces universally. It produces under
      the domination of direct physical need while man produces even when he is
      free from physical need and produces truly, indeed, only in freedom from
      such need. The animal produces only itself, while man reproduces the whole
      of nature. . . . It is precisely in his working over of the objective
      world, therefore, that man proves himself to be really a species being.
      This production is his active species-life. In and through such
      production, nature appears as his work and his reality. The object of
      labor, therefore, is the objectification of the species-life of man: for
      man duplicates himself not only intellectually, as in consciousness, but
      also actively, in reality, and therefore contemplates himself in a world
      that he has created.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Once again, the paradox I have in view is that the material conditions and
      conceptual rubrics out of which Unix developed are the epitome of
      capitalist endeavor, and yet Unix itself was circulated on quite
      anti-capitalist terms, answers fairly well to Marx's description of
      universal production (or production that doesn't answer to an immediate
      need).
    </p>
    <p>
      The tension between these two concepts--civil [or bourgeois] society as
      incarnated in the French Revolution's "Declaration of the Rights of Man,"
      and the "species-being" that (Marx says) these rights ignore--is precisely
      the enabling condition of capitalism:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      In so far as alienated labor tears the object of his production away from
      man, therefore, it tears away from him his species-life, his actual
      objectivity as a member of the species and transforms his advantage over
      the animal into the disadvantage that his inorganic body, nature, is taken
      away from him. . . . A direct consequence of man's alienation from the
      product of his labor, from his life activity, from his species-being, is
      the alienation of man from man. When man confronts himself, he confronts
      another man. . . . Generally, the proposition that man's species-being is
      alienated from him means that one man is alienated from another, just as
      each of them is alienated from human nature.<a name="13" href="#thirteen"
        >[13]</a
      >
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The second level of our paradox is that, when the MOO arises it answers,
      better than Unix or even capitalism itself, to Marx's description of
      alienation: within the MOO, when one confronts oneself, one literally
      confronts the representation of a representation of a person--a player, a
      character, a projection of (alienated) personality. And yet, again, the
      labor that goes into creation in the MOO is labor which answers exactly to
      the call of species-life: it is creation in the absence of need, the
      creation of a supremely useless object, an object world, an
      objectification of life in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brings me to the second chapter of this history, which begins about
      ten years after the invention of Unix, but still in the corporate
      neighborhood of AT&amp;T;, when Pavel Curtis and others at Xerox PARC
      invented MOOcode. MOOs are not intended to replace Unix in any sense, but
      they do mimic some of the functions of an operating system, and they
      mirror many of the features of Unix. In the MOO, which is really just a
      large database, the world is made up of objects: objects always have a
      particular location within the database and the fictive landscape of the
      MOO, and objects are in turn composed of properties and verbs. The
      universe itself is an object (object #0), as are all players. Players own
      themselves, and they belong to one or more classes of players.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic classes of MOO-character are player, programmer, and wizard.
      Many refinements and elaborations of that tripartite scheme have been
      implemented, but the basic distinctions remain significant: players can
      move around and communicate, but they cannot build or create things;
      programmers are players who can also create, program, and recycle their
      own objects, and they can bestow owned objects on others; wizards are
      programmers who can also program or recycle other programmers' objects and
      players themselves. To this extent, then, the MOO adopts the notion of a
      "root" user, expressing it more fancifully in the term "wizard"-- the
      superuser of all MOO users. In keeping with the dendritic hierarchy of
      files (and processes) in Unix, the MOO has its own (anthropomorphized)
      hierarchy of parents and children.Every object and player inherits the
      verbs and properties of its parent, and commands are always executed along
      a search path that includes one's entire parentage. In the moo, things can
      be readable, writable, and executable by wizards only, by the owner, or by
      anyone, and the system of parentage, in its effect, mimics the
      functionality of user groups --for example, the average player on PMC-MOO
      belongs to the programmer class, which in turn is a child of the basic
      builder class, which in turn is a child of Frand's player class, which in
      turn is a child of the basic player class. Such a player has permission to
      execute any verb associated with any group or class that appears in that
      family tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unix and MOOcode share the following characteristics, then: both emerged
      from large corporate research labs (Bell and Xerox, respectively); both
      are hierarchical, multi-user, time-sharing environments for the creation,
      storage, and retrieval of information; both systems are predicated on the
      notion that every object (or file) has both an owner and a location, and
      perhaps most importantly, both Unix and MOO function as command
      interpreters and as programming environments. It is this last thing, more
      than any other single feature, that unites MOOcode with Unix and
      distinguishes it from other forms of gaming and/or virtual-reality
      environments. The "OO" in MOO stands for Object Oriented, and it means
      that programmers can easily have access to the individual building blocks
      of the MOO, and can use the tools within the MOO to alter or add to those
      building blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The important difference between a MOO and the Unix operating system,
      though, is that while both may be considered to be mental representations,
      or self-representations, of information processing--models, if you will,
      of collective memory, of communal libraries, even of collective
      intelligence-- the MOO is the world it models, as well as the model of
      that world. In other words, if capitalism is a first-order model of the
      way labor and value and power circulate in the world, Unix is a
      second-order simulacrum of the way that a particular kind of capital,
      namely information, works in the world, and the MOO--an inhabitable model
      of Unix --is then a third-order simulacrum of the world, in which
      information is not only a representation of labor, and a source of power,
      and a form of value, but is also quite literally the form that the
      species-being takes, "not unreal, but a simulacrum, never again exchanging
      for what is real, but exchanging in itself, in an uninterrupted circuit
      without reference or circumference."<a name="13" href="#thirteen">[13]</a>
    </p>
    <h3>PMC-MOO: A Virtual Community</h3>
    <p>
      It's time now to discuss the way in which one such simulacrum has actually
      developed, and to think about the future of MOOs in general. PMC-MOO is
      the MOO with which I am most familiar, since I have been (with the help of
      many others)<a name="*" href="#acks">*</a> running it for the last couple
      of years, and since it has, at various times, taken up a good deal of my
      time. It is not the first MOO I started--the NCSU Virtual Campus has that
      dubious distinction <a name="14" href="#fourteen">[14]</a>--nor is it the
      newest (iath-moo, the virtual conference center for the Institute for
      Advanced Technology in the Humanities is the most recent), but it has
      become the largest and longest lasting of the MOO experiments with which
      I've been involved. PMC-MOO is an offshoot of the electronic journal
      Postmodern Culture, and it was established to serve two principal
      functions. First and foremost, it was intended to provide a text-based
      conferencing facility for journal-related activities, a kind of real-time
      supplement to PMC-Talk, the listserv-based discussion group that has
      always run alongside the peer-reviewed journal. Second, because the
      object-oriented nature of the MOO made this feasible, it was to provide an
      opportunity for interested users to produce interactive programs that
      would demonstrate or interrogate concepts of relevance to the study of
      postmodernism--object-lessons, if you will. In other words, from the
      outset, PMC-MOO had that Disney schizophrenia that characterizes Epcot
      Center--a conference hall surrounded by a theme park, work embedded in
      play.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time, quite a time, it seemed that work might never surface at all
      in this environment, and early visitors to the MOO would have been
      justified in doubting that this would ever develop into an environment in
      which anything useful could ever be done. MOOs are naturally somewhat
      chaotic, since the program allows everyone in a room to speak and be heard
      in sequence, with no possibility of interrupting another speaker and with
      little in the way of etiquette that encourages orderly, single-topic,
      limited-participation conversations. Users who have spent some time in
      MOOs do learn to use some common tools, such as the stage-talk feature, to
      identify the topic to which they are speaking or the speaker to whom they
      are responding, and (more importantly) they seem to develop a certain
      ability to do conversational multi-tasking, but the MOO tends to be a
      noisy place when there's anything happening at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the noise factor, there is the issue of identity and
      accountability. Professional life and professional credit depends, to a
      large extent, on being able to identify the sources of intellectual
      contributions, and on attributing borrowed ideas to their originators. The
      MOO, by contrast, encourages the borrowing of code, by making it easy to
      copy objects and verbs (or pieces of objects and verbs that seem useful)
      without attribution. The flip side of attribution is accountability: since
      most MOOs, including PMC-MOO (but not iath-moo) allow users to create
      fictitious names for their players, and since it is generally the case
      that only wizards can locate a player's home site, anti-social behavior
      including theft, harassment, impersonation, and even "virtual rape," are
      common problems in these virtual environments. PMC-MOOs most famous
      episode of anti-social behavior came to be described as MOO Terrorism, and
      is described elsewhere in a kind of MOO documentary.<a
        name="15"
        href="#fifteen"
        >[15]</a
      >
      After our rocky infancy, though, the community has stabilized a good deal,
      and it has begun to develop some of the familiar features of civic
      life--it has a zoning board, a board that reviews requests for quota (the
      permission to create things), regular public events including poetry slams
      and other performance events, social hours, and special seminars and
      events. It also has spawned a number of internal discussion groups on
      various topics, some of them theoretical, some of them social, some
      organizational. It is worth noting that, although postmodernism is steeped
      in the kind of theory that even educated non- specialists find difficult
      to penetrate, PMC-MOO has succeeded in drawing a broad range of
      non-specialists into the discussion of theoretical issues, and those
      non-specialists have frequently challenged and in other ways affected the
      conversation on those issues. High school students, college students,
      graduate students, professors, librarians, as well as non-academics,
      government workers, professionals: the population of PMC-MOO is diverse,
      if not by comparison to the general public, certainly by comparison to the
      usual audience for literary and critical theory. Furthermore, people whose
      background was non-technical have become interested in programming through
      the experience of inhabiting a shared programming environment, and
      especially (I think) as a result of being able to see and immediately
      share the results of their efforts from within the same environment in
      which they are produced. Some programming that demonstrates postmodern
      theoretical concepts has, in fact, been done, and efforts are underway to
      foreground that programming in the landscape of the MOO.
    </p>
    <p>
      What this factual history suggests is that, like its parent, Unix, the MOO
      has the capacity to turn play into something useful (though it isn't
      always easy to predict what kinds of play will prove useful, or in what
      ways), and it certainly fulfills the desire of the early Unix developers
      for a communal programming environment in which fellowship could come
      about. The MOO is also clearly an environment in which, independent of
      need, one can pursue creative activities with tangible, communal, and
      perhaps even economic results.<a name="16" href="#sixteen">[16]</a> As
      with pure research at Bell labs, it seems clear that in the MOO innovation
      comes from the ground up: in fact, the same thing could be said of the
      internet itself--that it was born from a monopoly (in this case, the
      military), and that due to certain external constraints (the threat of
      nuclear war, which dictated its decentralized design) it has developed
      into a chaotic, voluntarist, and unpredictably fertile world in which
      individuals invest large amounts of time and energy "playing" in ways that
      sometimes produce enormously useful innovations. As far as teaching and
      research go, the MOO (and the same could be said of the internet itself)
      is demonstrably useful for some kinds of pedagogical and conferencing
      purposes, particularly those which rely heavily on verbal information (as
      opposed to graphics or sound), and particularly when the community of
      users has developed a set of consensual rules of behavior that downplay
      the potential for communicational chaos and anti-social behavior, and that
      play up the potential for cooperation and collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      In closing, I'd like to recall for a moment a recent advertising campaign
      for AT&amp;T;, in which lots of "ordinary" (but very professional-looking)
      people are shown using technology in futuristic ways. The tag-line of the
      campaign is "have you ever ... You will": "Have you ever gone to a meeting
      in your bathrobe?" asks the voice-over, while a man lounges at the
      breakfast table while video-conferencing, "Or sent a fax from the beach?"
      while the man lounges in his beach-chair, sending a fax from his
      (apparently sand-proof) laptop: "You will." I'm sure that AT&amp;T;
      intends this campaign to present a happy vision of the future, in which
      work somehow is less work-like; I'm equally certain, though, that it's
      possible to view the campaign in exactly the opposite light, to hear an
      imperative tone in that "You Will," and to consider that, without that
      handy laptop, the man on the beach might not have to be working. It is, in
      some sense, the essence of professional occupation that it crosses the
      line into our personal lives: no profession is truly 9-5. If technology,
      born from useful play, becomes an environment in which work can be carried
      on in the guise of play, then either we will never really work, or we will
      never really play, after this. It remains to be seen which of these--or
      both, or neither--proves to be the case.

        It is a somewhat bitter irony that, on the very day I wrote this
        sentence, PMC-MOO crashed and--because of somewhat shoddy systems
        administration practices on my part--two weeks worth of changes to the
        database were lost. <a href="#11">Back</a>

        The National Institute of Standards and Technology, for example, in June
        of 1994 issued a call for proposals on the use of MUDs for
        manufacturing--a virtual shop floor, if you will. This brings my
        argument full circle, and perhaps raises the specter of virtual
        Taylorism... <a href="#17">Back</a>
