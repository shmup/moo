Ogre has been on this MOO for months, even before it changed
location. It is his opinion that many of the problems of
this MOO could be solved by creating a representative
government with a strict code of conduct for Wizards and
a higher level of responsibility for players. Rather than bog
the system down with extensive rules and regulations, the
flexibility of the medium should be employed to free the
wizards and players alike from the multitude of arbitrary
decision-making tasks. The prime importance of the MOO being
discussion, interaction and creativity in the theme of
Post Modern Culture.

Here are the 7 points supporters hold as true:

   1 - A regular wizardly presence is important so that
      new players can receive guidance and troublesome
      players can be dealt with quickly.
   2 - A Neutral Zone where "home made" verbs will not
      function should be created to allow new users and the
      inexperienced to MOO unmolested.
   3 - Players must be responsible for protecting themselves
      and following a few simple rules of conduct, not a
      volume of repressive legislation.
   4 - Wizards, when logging on as such, present a helpful
      and professional demeanor at all times.
   5 - Concerted effort must be made to create informative and
      intuitively interactive areas/communities where all
      players can go for instruction and entertainment in
      the Post Modern Culture Theme.
   6 - A list be created where players and wizards can discuss
      problems and/or ideas concerning MOO policy where ideas will
      be dealt with in a clear and timely fashion.
   7 - We believe Ogre's history has shown him creative and
      capable of handling the job of wizard, and believe that,
      as the author of these points, is particularly suited to
      seeing them met. Ogre should be made a wizard.
