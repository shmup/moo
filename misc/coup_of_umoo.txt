What follows is a slightly edited copy of my capture files from what I'm
calling the Coup of U-MOO. What's edited? I've deleted things like passwords
of mine, redundant '@who' checks (there are a lot in here), and various
bits of rubbish that didn't pertain to the situation (like my messages to
people on PMC-MOO telling them I'm busy, etc.). Toward the end of the first
section you'll see some of the commands I typed that never came out cuz the 
system lagged big-time and I logged out to get back on with a different 
term prg. If you don't like what you see or believe anything contained 
herein, fuck yerself cuz I don't really give a shit. Go write your own 
version. People will believe what they want to believe regardless of the 
factual content. Remember, history means 'his story'. Here's mine...

Visual_Mark [to brett]: Serious? That's what it was doing to me...              
Smack says, "with FTP gif sessions"                                             
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Really?                                                 
Smack nods.                                                                     
You say, "They have cameras?"                                                   
Smack nods                                                                      
You say, "Whoa."                                                                
Smack nods.                                                                     
Visual_Mark [to rivit]: Try logging in as 'test'                                
Visual_Mark [to brett]: 'rivit' won't work anymore?                             
brett says, "can't cd .. ;)"                                                    
brett says, "uh uh"                                                             
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: What's it look like?                                    
Visual_Mark [to brett]: You mean out 'uploads'?                                 
Smack [to Visual_Mark]: what does what look like? the site? it looks like a     
 site.                                                                          
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: I can't scope it right now, I'm using different         
 software.                                                                      
Visual_Mark grins at Smack.                                                     
You say, "The copy of Mosaic the skewl gives you is wack."                      
Smack says, " its just got some pictures of some chick posing rather risque"    
Visual_Mark [to brett]: Hee hee, you're reading the log file...

Smack says, " but if you subscribe... WOW!"                                     
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: How do you pay 'em money? Credit card?                  
Sedate says, "I dunno."                                                         
Smack says, " mail em a check, I dunno..."                                      
Sedate says, "WHo wants to be an admin?"                                        
Smack [to Sedate]: shut up                                                      
Smack says, " I DO! I DO!"

You say, "What the fuck?"                                                       
Sedate [to Smack]: oh cute...                                                   
Sedate laughs!

 bastards would respond..."                                                              
You say, "What post?"

Visual_Mark shrugs its shoulders.                                               
Smack says, " damn wont let me change your password either!"                    
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Heh?

Sedate's Crypto Lab (#1551) may have been bugged by Fish and Sedate.            

You say, "Hee hee."

Visual_Mark snickers under its breath.                                          
Smack is wacking the whole moo

"sedate" is not the name of any player.

Visual_Mark [to rivit]: You say you can't move up past 'uploads'?               
Smack says, " i am teaching him a lesson, right now we are secure...."          
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Wonder if he has access to the machine it's running     
 on...

Sedtest is immoral.                                                             
Visual_Mark opens a capture file.                                               
Nemesis arrives in a cloud of darkness!                                         
The cloud dissipates behind Nemesis.                                            
Nemesis waves.                                                                  
Sedtest [to Nemesis]: Hi, I think it will be a while before the Admin class     
 has all the bugs worked out...                                                 
Smack waves.                                                                    
Visual_Mark [to Nemesis]: Hola                                                  
Sedtest laughs!                                                                 
Smack nods to sedate.                                                           
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: I already have that...                                 
Visual_Mark [to brett]: Can you still log in with a pwd?                        
Sedtest [to Visual_Mark]: I know, but I didn't see it there so I upped it...    
brett [to Visual_Mark]: no                                                      
Fish teleports in.                                                              
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: That's just a dir I'm testing it out on...             
Fish waves.                                                                     
Nemesis [to Smack]: How can I make something like *moo-chat or *lemurs?         
Visual_Mark bows to Fish.                                                       
Sedtest has never seen a system type of MS-DOS.                                 
Fish is rolling on the floor laughing!                                          
brett [to Visual_Mark]: yes i can                                               
Sedtest [to Nemesis]: just ask...                                               
Visual_Mark [to brett]: Kewl.                                                   
Visual_Mark [to brett]: Can you "cd .." ?                                       
Fish . o O (just here for the conversation..)                                   
Smack says, " make  #46"                                                        
Sedtest nods in agreement with Smack.                                           
Smack says, " and put it in the mail room or something"                         
Nemesis says, "Don't work."                                                     
brett [to Visual_Mark]: yeah                                                    
Sedtest [to Nemesis]: perm denied?                                              
Nemesis says, "Can't put in mail room."                                         
Visual_Mark [to brett]: Damn...                                                 
Nemesis nods in agreement with Sedtest.                                         
Sedtest [to Nemesis]: hmm..well you can always just carry it with you..or 
can you not make one?                                                              
Smack [to Fish]: howdy... you know Sedate is a Toad?                            
Sedtest [to Smack]: big bug its the @set huh?                                   
Fish [to Sedate]: ..nice one..                                                  
Fish is rolling on the floor laughing!                                          
Smack [to Sedate]: yup..                                                        
brett [to Visual_Mark]: anything interesting on your site?                      
Sedtest nods in agreement with Fish.                                            
Visual_Mark [to brett]: THat's my HD, dude.                                     
Sedtest [to brett]: uh huh, hes got WINBABES!!!!!!                              
Visual_Mark smirks at Sedate.                                                   
brett [to Visual_Mark]: i know, I ain't stpid                                   
Nemesis says, "It won't recognize it as a mail recipient!"                      
Sedtest feels like he's giving vm a rectal exam probing about his HD.           
Smack [to Fish]: you know you aint a wiz?                                       
Visual_Mark [to brett]: It's not set up to be a site just yet. The 'uploads     
 dir has more stuff...                                                          
Visual_Mark smirks at Sedate.                                                   
brett says, "ooh, a rectal exam"                                                
brett lets out a long sigh.                                                     
Sedtest [to Visual_Mark]: will it only be operating while you have a            
 connection or do we use the moo for the addres?                                
Sedtest has had a penile exam...bleah....                                       
Sedtest says, "stick that nasty thing own yer dick...."                         
brett [to Fish]: uhh, hello?

Sedtest says, "Now this might hurt a bit when you pee next....shyea right!!!!"  
Fish [to brett]: ah...hi..                                                      
Sedtest [to Fish]: brett                                                        
Sedtest [to brett]: fish                                                        
Visual_Mark [to brett]: What'd you do, get a ls -lR?                            
You say, "Oop."                                                                 
Visual_Mark grins.                                                              
brett grins.                                                                    
brett grins at Visual_Mark.                                                     
Visual_Mark [to brett]: Funny.                                                  
Sedtest [to brett]: I liked your old title better than (Immortal)               
brett [to Visual_Mark]: you punk                                                
You say, "You can finger me, but no more poking around."                        
Visual_Mark snickers under its breath.                                          
Sedtest [to Visual_Mark]: but I wanna probe.....                                
Nemesis just eye-balled your player...                                          

Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Still here?                                             

Smack nods.

Visual_Mark can smell angry msg's...                                            
Visual_Mark grins.

Sedtest [to Smack]: hey I thought of some security for anarchy....              
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Hee hee!

Smack laughs.                                                                   
Fish [to brett]: trying to pick up...                                           
Fish is rolling on the floor laughing!                                          
Nemesis raises his arms and a cloud of darkness forms around him!               
The cloud dissipates.                                                           
Nemesis is gone!                                                                
Fish goes home.                                                                 
Sedtest [to Smack]: how about a loop that makes everyone in connected_players() 
 wiz=1 that way it should cancel some idiot removing the bits...                
Smack [to Sedtest]: like what?                                                  
Sedtest [to Smack]: that would elliminate a big problem...                      
Sedtest says, "gotta go talk...brb"                                             
Smack says, " ya, as well as some restriction on @recycle, actullay we dont     
 care if people strip bits"                                                     
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Heh?                                                   
Smack [to Sedtest]: wait...                                                     
Sedtest [to Smack]: well stripping bits removes the permissions for ANYTHING    
 to run, like notify()                                                          
Sedtest [to Smack]: so when the bit on #2 is removed everything goes fucked.    
Smack [to Sedate]: only if you wack wizard.... are you gonna reboot the moo?    
Smack says, " you could loop just to perm him"                                  
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Hurry, back up the db!                                  
Visual_Mark grins.                                                              
Smack already has twice...                                                      
Sedtest [to Smack]: depends, if you give the bits back nope..I gotta go talk,   
 but if you do anything fucked yeah it has to be rebooted...                    
Sedtest says, "gotta run....."                                                  
Sedtest has disconnected.                                                       
Smack says, " you would think that he would want to talk to me"                 
Smack says, " I think I will recycle some of his shit for poor protocol"        
Visual_Mark smirks.                                                             
Visual_Mark [to fish]: So what's goin down?                                     
You say, "Oop."                                                                 
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Did you boot fish?                                      
Smack says, " nopes"                                                            
You say, "Oh, he's still on."                                                   
Visual_Mark [to brett]: Was there anything on the 'ol HD you wanted?            
brett [to Visual_Mark]: no                                                      
Visual_Mark shrugs its shoulders.                                               
brett says, "brb"                                                               
Visual_Mark nods.                                                               
brett teleports out.                                                            
Visual_Mark needs to find some NetWare docs.                                    
You say, "Hmmm."

You join brett (Immortal).

Crystal Prism
A patch o' grass and a pile of dirt.
There is a little opening right behind the pile of dirt.  It looks to small to
 just walk right through so you'll have to get down on all fours and 'crawl'.
Just type 'crawl'.
You see Da Bar and Chalk Board here.
Prowler and brett (Immortal) are here.

For the best picture, please adjust your tracking.

You say, "What's up?"
brett says, "not much"
Prowler waves to Visual_Mark.
Visual_Mark bows to Prowler.
brett [to Prowler]: not too deep
You say, "waiting for the apocalypse?"
Visual_Mark grins.

Subject:  poor judgement and more...

I just wanted to note, Sedate's Admin Class has a big hole in it.
I know cause I told him it would... and he didn't listen to me
cause he thinks he is so smart... anyway he went ahead and made it
against everyones better judgement and advice, and then went ahead
with its implementation. I was happy to have the first oppurtunity
to find its holes. To teach Sedate a lesson, I started off with a 
little @toading, and then moved on to bigger and better things.
I have stripped all the wizard bits and over ridden the root-wiz password.
Unless they reboot the server, I have complete control. 
I shall take it upon myself to restructure the political system here,
as I too believe, too many wizards spoil the soup...
Given that the current DB remains, I will get back with you all about
the re-establishment of the wizardy

With Love,
Smack

Smack has kidnapped the moo...how is not important now...that he did is..
You can nortt just go and redo a moo just because you feel like proving a
 point... it is one thing to plan on it and another to just do it..it's wrong
 and it needs to stop..
The point is made replace the moo and let's do this democaticlly not like..umm

Ok I don't agree with the Admin thing either but taking over a moo and trying
 to wipe it out, what is the problem there??
I know that you are trying to prove a point but what is it you are doing??
What makes you think that you can just shut down anything you want, what about
 the rest of us that want a moo and not have it taken over by someone who
 disagrees with Sedate.
It's not fair to you or to anyone else that MOO on here.
Just think first, don't act stupid.

Smack [to Sedate]: good maybe it will teach you a little fucking humility, its
 called ego death, deal with it!
Sedate grins at Smack.
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: If he really wanted to do damage he could have
 recycled #2 or some shit...
Sedate [to Smack]: so its too big to die, just a bit hurt.
Smack  huh?
Sedate [to Smack]: the point I liked you, I trusted you, that is the entire

Sedate [to Smack]: what is there to have learned besides don't trust anyone?
Smack says, " and I DIDNT put it there..."
You say, "you guys are like a couple girls fighting over borrowing the others'

Visual_Mark smirks.
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: wit.
Smack [to Sedate]: dont play coy, you screw head...
Sedate [to Smack]: yeah well I didn't make the MOO server.
Smack [to you]: did you see the sign in the anti-wiz headquarters?

Visual_Mark returns.
Sedate nods.
Sedate says, "it'll be started in the morning..."
Smack says, " if it crahes during shutdown it can be bad news"

Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Yeah, the sign and all the messages on *MOO are in my

Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: You can't blame any one person.
Smack says, " I have 3 windows open"
Sedate says, "well this'll be a good chance for me to get access to the MOO
 account.."
Smack says, " and I am sending commands in all of them"
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: yeah I know, me and him.
Sedate points at Smack.
Visual_Mark grins at Sedate.
Smack says, " we didnt crash the mOO"
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: me for being such a trusting idiot.
Smack says, " that was not my intent"
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: And Brett.
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: and him for being him.
Smack says, " I expected a reboot'"
Sedate [to smach]: bullshit.
You say, "Heh."
Smack shrugs.
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Then why didn't it happen immediamente?
Smack says, " and if not, then tomarrow i would have given bits to anyone who
 asked"
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: blaming brett is like blaming looters for looting
 dutring a riot, its something you do.
Smack says, " then the rioters are also to blame"
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Well...
Visual_Mark grins at Smack.
Sedate says, "tho he will still be @blacklisted."
Smack says, " those fucking babies"
You say, "Yeah! We're ALL to blame!"
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Why?
Smack says, " I should have toaded them"
Visual_Mark nods in agreement with Smack.
Sedate [to Smack]: no, they neither, just you, the incitor.
Sedate says, "and me the idiot."
Sedate [to Smack]: the fool.
Smack says, " then feel free to @toad me from you MOO"
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: May as well @blacklist yourself, too.
Sedate [to Smack]: naw, oyu wouldn't care.
Visual_Mark grins.
Smack says, " I didnt do nuthin nasty"
Smack says, " just tried to fix what I saw wsa broken"
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: The capture files tell all...
Smack says, " if I hadent done it some one else woudl have"
Sedate nods in agreement with Smack.
Smack says, " and they might have been nastier"
Smack says, " you implemented that WITHOUT any popular consent"
You say, "hmm. time for some sugary dessert..."
Visual_Mark is away from the keyboard right now.
Smack says, " I am all for isocracy myself... wiz everybody..."
Sedate [to Smack]: it wasn't impimented at all..I just wanted to see if oyu
 tought it was good, there were no other admins..
Smack says, " well you started handing it out like it was ready"
Smack says, " what fucking use did I have for it?"
Smack says, " I dont need or deserve a bit, or didnt you read my post to *wiz?"
Visual_Mark grins.
Sedate [to Smack]: I posted that note to see if the complainers would
 volunteer, thus confirming my thoughts that they didnt think they were gonne
 get power, so why should anyone else?
Smack says, " I posted that I would hack it, if given the oppurtunity"
Visual_Mark hopes those posts are intact still...

Smack [to you]: that was our one cycle
You say, "Heh."
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Blame me! I wanna be the scapegoat!
Smack says, " the @shutdown is in process"
Visual_Mark nods.
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: its ok the text will only substatiate me.
Smack says, " but brett ticked WAY out, didnt even come up with the task
 number I bet..."
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Uh...
Sedate says, "people can see your @shutdown message."
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: I'm just an historian here. I have no biases either
 way.
You fall down laughing.
You say, "I'm a neutral party."
Visual_Mark snickers under its breath.
Sedate says, "tho' I am not going to go to school tomorrow."
Visual_Mark has cranked the rumor mill good and hard...
With a puff of steam and perfume, the Rumor Mill cranks out :
     "Goat spends a bunch of time perusing the alt.sex.beastiality newsgroup."
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Good excuse... 'my dog ate my MOO'...
Smack [to Sedate]: how come?
Visual_Mark grins.
Smack says, " viva la revolucion..."
Smack says, " tell em you meant for that to happen"
Sedate says, "i fact I should mail the sys-admin explaining the whole
 thing...and how there was a bug in admin that some player got ahold of, and
 they fucked around, then how brett crashed it..."
Smack says, " it was an expirement"
Visual_Mark looks for Che Guevera to pop out of the woodwork.
Smack says, " what did I have to do with brett crashing the moo"
Smack says, " he wanted me to make him an admin the little prick"
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: What's his address and I can mail him a doctored
 capture file. ;)
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: sure, I'll even explain that it was all captured...
Visual_Mark smirks.
Smack [to Sedate]: some player? I am hurt, Im not just any old phreak...
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Double-plus good!
Sedate says, "Wow, I'm even begining to believe myself."
Visual_Mark grins at Smack.
Sedate kisses Smack lightly on the cheek.
Sedate [to Smack]: oh Smack, life is never dull with you around.
You say, "We've always been at ware with Eastasia."
You say, "ware=war"
Smack says, " happyhead pages, hello splat, start counting flat boy, its
 coming soon..."
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Eh?
Smack sighs.
Sedate says, "I will explain that maybe admin isnt a good idea unless we can
 guarantee there won't be any bugs..."
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Wow, he's gonna be almost as popular as you!
Smack says, " dont ask me"
Smack says, " admin is not a good idea period"
Sedate says, "happyhead pages what?"
Smack says, " hello splat, start counting flat boy, its coming soon..."
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: no he won't I wont give him the opportunity for fame,
 it will all go to brett.

Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: really wanna be famous?
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Shit, authority on what?
Smack [to you]: nice abuse of brett eh?
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Abuse?
Sedate [to Smack]: I dunno, both bookish and Defender have said that now...it

Lazarus falls rapidly from the sky into the room and lands with a loud >>
 *SPLAT!* << sound.  Ouch... I bet that hurts!
Lazarus says, "greets..."
Visual_Mark grins at Smack.
Smack [to Sedate]: you are so persecuted, just like jesus.
Lazarus says, "whas up?"
Visual_Mark bows to Lazarus.
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Much has happened in your absence.
Smack [to Lazarus (may have been bugged by Ashley)]: howdy
Lazarus gives Visual_Mark a serious wedgie!
Lazarus [to Visual_Mark]: as usual...
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Hey, we've started a temple of Sedate...
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: S'okay, I'm playing historian on this one...
Visual_Mark pats his hard drive.
Visual_Mark smirks.
Lazarus [to Smack]: tell me about the @audit verb of MOOt... how can you block
 it - a core db mod?
Smack [to you]: cool, I ported the cybernetic lab BTW 
Lazarus [to Sedate]: greets...
Visual_Mark grins at Smack.
Smack [to Lazarus (may have been bugged by Ashley)]: i think so, or actually
 you just remove the object from your .owned_objects..
Lazarus says, "a temple of Sedate?"
Lazarus says, "a statue?"
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Wanna work on it?
Lazarus says, "who's getting 15 minutes of fame now, Seddy?"
Lazarus smirks.
You say, "It's in Arius's shit right now, but I can log in as him and @chown
 it..."
Smack is.
sual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Smack, Brett, Sedate, and Grandma Moses.
Smack says, " you can chown here?"
Smack says, " i dont think so..."
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Can't you?
You say, "never done it"
Lazarus [to Smack]: doubtful...
Smack shakes his head.
Smack says, " i dont think so..."
You say, "hmm, how else can you open it up for modding by others...?"
Lazarus [to Smack]: .owned_objects here is owned by Wizard #2 and they deny
 permission on it...
>> Time is now Fri Nov 18 03:03:38 1994 EST
Smack says, " change the perms to +w"
You say, "kewl"
Smack [to Lazarus (may have been bugged by Ashley)]: then you are screwed...
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Still here?
Smack [to you]: he is crying
Lazarus [to Smack]: what if I create my own player class that's a copy of my
 current one?  Will all the props and verbs revert over to my ownership or do
 they retain their owners props?
Smack [to Sedate]: maybe if you had begged...
Visual_Mark smirks.
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: idlechild
Smack [to Lazarus (may have been bugged by Ashley)]: depends, probably on that
 one, it will still be wiz owned
Lazarus screams horribly and dies before your eyes, slumping into a heap of
 tattered rags.  The ground opens up underneath him and swallows him whole!

Lazarus smacks his head with Smack!
Visual_Mark bows to Vengeance.
There has been a change to news article 29 (RiverMOO Grand Opening).  Please

Visual_Mark has an edit job to get to...
Smack [to Vengeance]: odd spelling you got there..
Lazarus says, "duh... I didn't remember to +w the props... sheesh.  Picked a

Visual_Mark will idle for a bit...

Sedate says, "anyone have @paste?"
You say, "I'll be popping over every min or so..."
Sedate was out writing letters...
Smack  nopes.
Visual_Mark nods in agreement with Sedate.
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Why?
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: I have a letter to @paste...
Lazarus says, "somewhere there's a paste... VM has one."
Smack [to you]: give it to im...
You say, "Ummm..."
You say, "It's on an @fo here..."
-----------------------Sedate (#6473) @pastes:------------------------
Yes, unfortunatley there was a big hole in the class, Smack ot a hold of
it and was about to have a little fun at my expense, but brett decided
that now was the time to crash the MOO, he has crashed Lambda MOO on
occaision, so he is rather experienced at it, and I think he did a pretty
good job, so tomorrow who can first please type help @blacklist and use
the appropriate @blacklist or @redlist on his site, and @toad him, and
@newt smack until further discussion, oh yeah and please type @rmverb
$admin:@chparent and @rmverb $admin:@set  this was how he gained access,
and yes Magenta, I will have to ask Pavel how it happened because I have
no idea that there was a hole in chparent() like that, I figured that -f
meant an object wasn't fertile, mayybe we should type @seel for holes in
out core, i think there might be one onhings back in order.

You say, "Wow."

You say, "I got it all."

You smile.
Lazarus says, "um, what exactly is 'afoot'?"
Sedate smiles at Smack.
Lazarus says, "the short version..."
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Hey, you can't kill the patsy just yet...
Sedate [to Lazarus]: vm will  send you the capture file.
Visual_Mark nods in agreement with Lazarus.
Smack says, " if they boot one of my DB's then there will be no wizards.."
Lazarus says, "aaaah... heh"
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Bascially it's like this...
Sedate nods in agreement with Smack.
Smack says, " the MOO shutdown BTW"
Sedate [to Smack]: but I told the sys-admin to boot oe form before midnight.
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Sedate made an admin class on U-MOO...
You say, "He let Smack beta-test it, who hack wiz perms, stipped everyone
 else's wiz bit..."
Sedate [to Lazarus]: and smack hacked it and crashed the MOO
You say, "while brett (aka rivit) fork()ed the fuck out of something that sent
 it on a tailspin..."
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: by saying he hacked it makes it sound like he did
 something...
Lazarus says, "UMOO?"
Smack didnt know he was beta-testing... thought he was first on the block,
Sedate nods in agreement with Lazarus.
Visual_Mark nods in agreement with Lazarus.
Lazarus says, "oh"
You say, "anyway, that's my unofficial blurb based on what I've seen..."
You say, "history = his story"
Lazarus hands out machetes...
Lazarus . o O ( destroy the evidence... )
Sedate nods in agreement with Lazarus.
Visual_Mark grins at Lazarus.
Smack says, " well the moo shutdown, good luck finding something before
 midnight thogu"
Smack says, " the DB backed up while I was on... and the shutdown will make a
 copy too, that means mine are the only 2 copies (i think)"
Lazarus smirks.
Visual_Mark grins.
Sedate [to Smack]: yeah I know.
You say, "find what?"
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: ooh
Lazarus says, "it getting hard to keep up with all the MOO's and wizards
 lately."
Sedate [to Smack]: might lose a bit of work, but thats ok, I haven't done much
 lately.
Smack says, " mostly you just keep 2 backups and one current, which is down..."
Lazarus [to Visual_Mark]: didja get that VIC-20 tinyMOO port, heh.
Vengeance has disconnected.
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Not yet... ;)
Smack [to Sedate]: why not boot one of mine, I will give you my pass word ...
Visual_Mark is editing the capture files, hence the lag in response...
You say, "only editing out sensitive info, like pwd's to my ftp site, etc..."
Lazarus says, "who was the V-man?"
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: how long will it be up?
Smack [to you]: clean up my spelling if you would...
Visual_Mark shrugs to Lazarus.
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: What?
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Funny.
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: yeah and edit me out too huh?
Lazarus [to Visual_Mark]: fed... blackhat... hangar 18 - probably kibo
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Edit the peanuts out of my shit.
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Hee hee.
You say, "ooh, this is good stuff..."
Smack [to Sedate]: actually if you have to log in to one of my DB's ...
Smack [to Sedate]: use smack2 blah
Sedate [to Smack]: oh, thanks.
Smack says, " he has a bit, but is not a wizard, you will have to hack your
 way through that"
Smack says, " or change my password and log in as me"
Sedate [to Smack]: what kiind of bit?
Smack says, " a wiz bit"
Smack says, " wizard = 1"
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Hey, what did rivit do on MOOt?
Smack says, " but I couldnt @chparent"
Sedate nods.
Smack [to you]: a bunch of dumb shit
You say, "like?"
Smack says, " he crashed it by riding the bike ride 100 times"
Visual_Mark smirks.
You fall down laughing.
Smack says, " I dont remember what all else..."
Visual_Mark chuckles.
You say, "Phuckin bike ride."
Visual_Mark snickers under its breath.
The housekeeper arrives to cart Vengeance off to bed.

Visual_Mark has cranked the rumor mill good and hard...

     "Alister licks things that may be illegal to lick... like 11-year-olds."
Lazarus says, "mountain bike ride..."
Sedate says, "ME TOO!!!!!!!"
Sedate [to Smack]: pretty stable site tho huh?
Smack [to Sedate]: me too what?
Smack says, " oh 11 yearolds"
Sedate says, "likes 11 yr olds."
Sedate nods.
Smack [to Sedate]: till the end....
You say, "Shit..."
Smack says, " wasnt when rivit crashed it, I dont think..."
Visual_Mark snickers under its breath.
Lazarus whistles innocently.
Smack wonders what HappyHead meant... 
Sedate [to Smack]: he knows what happened, I think he's trying to be

Smack says, " oooo scary..."
Smack says, " what does he _know_?"
Smack says, " and what are my just deserts?"
You say, "flatboy!"
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: FLATBOT FLATBOY FLATBOY!
Smack laughs at his two-dimintiality
Sedate [to Smack]: I dunno, I got mail from him to all the wizzes, lemme paste
 it...
Smack laughs.
Smack says, "nemesis called him, what a whiner..."
Smack says, " I should have toaded them all, brett first..."
Sedate says, "Nemesis is a whiner yes, and a kiss ass you should see the mail
 form him to *wiz..."
Smack says, " but I told them I wouldnt, so they fucking spammed me"
Sedate says, "Anyways, I check my mail..and theres a letter from HHead.....in
 it he says....and I hadn't spoken with him either let me tell you...:"

 science - I miss all the fun...

Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Yep.
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: how much?
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: For what?
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: is your site gonna be open alla time?
You say, "a core dump?"
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: No, one of my accts. at UO.
Smack says, " Sandy would be pissed, and she has some BAD-ASS hacker on call,
 not a good lady to fuck with..."
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: huh what core dump?
Visual_Mark smirks at Smack.
You say, "It's not her acct."
Smack [to you]: its her computer
Sedate [to Smack]: so, no way to get into our school, it locked tight except
 for the MOO...
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Not my Pentium machine.
Smack says, " and the hard disk is full of old shit..."
You say, "Huh?"
Smack [to you]: I am talking about mail bombs
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: What are you talking about?
You say, "I have 23 meg free, 100 more when I nuke my Linux partition..."
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: my wiz's want to mail bomb him...
Smack [to Sedate]: the lady knows hackers at Uwindsor, I am sure...
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Who? Smack or Brett?
Smack postures... :)
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Which lady?
Visual_Mark loses it.
Smack says, " SANDY STONE!"
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Ah!
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: Sharon Stones older sister.
Lazarus says, "Fax bombs are better... a hands on job..."
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: I was confused, I thought you were talking about
 Sandie, my gf...
Smack sighs.
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Lotsa black paper.
Smack wishes he had logged in from eden.com
Lazarus shoves a roll of Rush Limbaugh getting cornholed by Hillary with a
 handy litt snap on job.  Tres graphique!
You say, "What am I missing here? Everyone talks at once and I'm trying to
 edit a fucking file! Geez, where's the brain lag when I need it?"
tVisual_Mark [to Smack]: Whyzat?
Smack reaches into the cigar box, selects a fine Cuban cigar, and lights up.
Smack ***Puff***
Smack [to you]: that site has plenty-o-room,
Lazarus grins at Smack.
Smack ***Puff***
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: What do you need room for?
You say, "letter bomb?"
Smack [to you]: mail BOMBS!
tisual_Mark [to Smack]: Why?
Sedate says, "yeah I better call 'em of...."
Sedate will be right back.
Smack sighs.
Visual_Mark smirks at Sedate.

Smack is glad he didnt have to beg.

 doughheads that are supposedly plotting against you as we speak?
Lazarus removes some rice papers from the pouch of drum tobacco and begins to
 roll a cigarette by hand.
Smack ***Puff***
Slowly Lazarus rolls...
Smack ***Puff***
Lazarus [to Visual_Mark]: never complain about spam... heh - you just get
 more, historian.
Lazarus smirks at Visual_Mark.
Smack [to you]: yes, if they mailbomb the actlab, it will fuck up our memory..
 and fuck up other peoples mail, that pisses sandy off, and THAT is not good.
Lazarus continues rolling...
Smack says, " that for instance is why Point got yacked with no warning"
Visual_Mark nods in agreement with Smack.
Smack ***Puff***
Smack ***Puff***
Smack [to you]: good thing I didnt get nasty I guess, I didnt even think about

Lazarus puts his rolling supplies away for VM's sanity sake.
Smack ***Puff***
Smack says, "let them eat spam..."
Visual_Mark grins at Lazarus.
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: heh

Lazarus [to Smack]: ...'given the choice, they with vote for more spam and
 circuses...'
Smack reaches over to the ashtray and snuffs out his cigar.
Smack gets tired, waits for Sedate's return.
Smack expects he is giving them my addresses and making suggestions.
------------------------------- Visual_Mark -------------------------------
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Wonder if he has access to the machine it's running 
  on...
You say, "physical access."
Smack shrugs. 
Smack says, " ya that is the answer, though nothing is damaged yet"
Smack says, " I havve locked out all the wizard bits, and the root wizard's
  password"
Smack is laughing HARD!
Sedtest teleports in.
Sedtest kisses brett lightly on the cheek.
Sedtest [to brett]: why are you immortal?
Sedtest is immoral.
Visual_Mark opens a capture file.
------------------------ Visual_Mark stops pasting ------------------------
Done @pasting.
Visual_Mark snickers under its breath.
Smack says, " is that where it starts?"
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Newp. Starts with you telling me about that brothel
 and Sedate ports in...
Smack [to you]: yeesh, cut out that irrelevant stuff. 
Visual_Mark nods.
Lazarus [to Visual_Mark]: the short version... heh
You say, "Only 3 or 4 lines before Sedate comes on."
Smack says, " and remove that t after smack shrugs t"
You say, "I'm only cutting redundant @sweeps and shit liek that."
tVisual_Mark [to Smack]: No.
Smack grings.
You smile.
Lazarus [to Visual_Mark]: see if you can make Smack's teeth gleam when you go
 in for the closeup!
Smack gags, has the lights off, cant see his damn fingers, has the monitor on
 REALLYlow.
Visual_Mark grins at Lazarus.
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Where the fuck is Sedate? Is he walking down to the
 lab or something?
Smack [to you]: dont have to make me look good, just clean up the typos!
-----------------------Sedate (#6473) @pastes:------------------------
Ok, dear Smack has atoned a bit, he didn't know brett was going to crash
our site, so he shut it down before it could cause anymore damage, and
supplied me with the password for smack2 (bleh is the pass btw) So if we
could restart the second youngest db save and clean things up a bit (the
only thing he did was remove all our bits) then we should be all fine, uh
still @newt him, and no'one make anymore players until things are
completely clean ok, and btw, no mail bomb, we are bigger than that.
Tosh
PS still @newt Smack, if oyu don't know how to hack a wiz bit back thens an
 Admin, so type @set me.wizard to 1
then type @copy #4:@chparent    then type @chparent me to #58   then give
us all back wizardf
its not one of us, don;t forget to @toad brett and @blacklist etc...
Tosh
----------------------------End of @paste-----------------------------
Lazarus [to Visual_Mark]: and if Seddy appears anywhere - make it look like
 he's well hung...
Sedate says, "FUCK IT ALWAYS EATS MY TEXT!!!!"
Lazarus smirks.

Smack says, " not bleh"
Lazarus says, "this the same Brett from MOOt?"
Smack nods.
Sedate nods.
isual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Of course. My homey in Seattle.
You smile at Smack.
You say, "Weird. I'm friends with the whole fuckin posse."
Smack says, " you can use smack2 to set your own wiz bit, but not @chparent,
 your parent might be screwed cause of the toad, but everybodyelse can be
 permed"
Lazarus [to Visual_Mark]: jester
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Tee hee.
Sedate [to Smack]: no, just @copy #4:@chparent...
Smack says, " I couldnt get that to work either"
Smack says, " but I was being harassed when I was trying"
Smack says, " it has to do with the (set_task_perms)"
Lazarus [to Smack]: the gleaming teeth thingy was HARDLY harassment.
Lazarus sits cross-legged on the floor.
Visual_Mark smirks at Lazarus.
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Jester.
Sedate [to Smack]: hmm..oh mebbe it set them back to player and not #2?
Visual_Mark puts on a point cap and jingly shoes.
You say, "pointy"
Smack [to Lazarus (may have been bugged by Ashley)]: I meant that I couldnt
 copy #4:@chparent cause I was being assaulted
Lazarus [to Visual_Mark]: Crag thinks one line of shout spam is harassment...
Smack says, " but had I managed  I would have toaded them ALL!"
Sedate says, "who's crag?"
You say, "feh"
Lazarus [to Sedate]: some Wiz from chiba... he doesn't like shouting when he's
 idiling... clutters his widdle scween...
Sedate says, "Oh, one of the wizards at UMOO wiz's at chiba, geesh and he's an
 idiot too."
Sedate says, "like me."
Lazarus wedgies Crag/Trebor hard until his eyes pop out!
Sedate says, "huh?"
Smack [to Sedate]: BTW I have a 6 other characters at UMOO with bad addresses,
 never used, and wiz bits on them, I also sprinkled a couple #2 permed verbs
 onto system objexts...
Visual_Mark grins at Smack.
Sedate nods.
Sedate [to Smack]: ok...good...
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Why you telling man? ;)
Lazarus says, "basically I made enemies there on day one by shouting one
 time... a friendly little YEEEEHAW after coding about 30 verbs... I was due! 
 Then I argued my case before a tribunal of wizards in real time... the
 consensus was that Crag/Trebor was a deek."
Smack says, " I figured this could be protracted, and I dont want to give up
 my new found power"
Smack [to you]: he'll know when i take over again anyway..
Sedate nods in agreement with Smack.
You say, "Heh."
Smack actually wishes he had made $speller:make_wiz
Sedate laughs!
Sedate says, "yuck..."
Smack says, " wouldnt be much fun the second time though.. I would love to
 toad nemesis, fish, jolly rodger, and whoever else needs it..."
Smack says, " @recycle em infact"
Lazarus says, "is that anything like $builder:take_pee?"
Sedate nods in agreement with Smack.
Lazarus hits a rimshot.
Sedate says, "YES!!!!"
Smack says, " should have @recycled brett"
Smack [to Lazarus (may have been bugged by Ashley)]: yes only wiz permed
Lazarus . o O ( $recycler:recycle(player) )
Smack says, " that might have stopped his processes."
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: So what did you do earlier? Just send mail?
Sedate nods.
Smack [to Sedate]: well you put that verb on $speller, and Ill say I did it,
 and @recycle those assholes..
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Are you in communicatin with any of the other players
 from U-MOO?
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: I hoe this teaches them that they should give me
 access to the MOO account...
Smack [to Sedate]: or take your wiz bit away
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: He's lookin for access from all this. Heh.
Visual_Mark nods in agreement with Smack.
Smack laughs.
Sedate [to Smack]: hmmmm....I'll think about it, I find it funny how they all
 reacted so feircly to your tyranny.
Smack [to Sedate]: what tyranny, I was going to liberate them!
Lazarus [to Visual_Mark]: I say we gather the slaves and start building that
 pyramid for Sedate...
Lazarus [to smirk]: smack
Smack turns his screen even lower...
Sedate says, "well thats not how they see it, and thats not how it will be
 written in UMOO historty, in fact I will tell them that their fighting you
 saved the MOO from being destryoyed...""
Lazarus shouts a slogan, "Workers of the world, RELAX!" and salutes.
Smack [to Sedate]: that is fine with me, I hate that MOO, I only go there to
 see you...
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Yes, they mobilized quickly...
Sedate nods.
Visual_Mark smirks at Sedate.
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Shit, we've got a regular cover up in progress...
Smack [to Sedate]: actually they prevented me from stopping brett you know...
Sedate says, "I know, there were two rooms filled, one was Anti-Wizard HQ, and
 the other was my room with oyu an d smack and brett"
Lazarus [to Sedate]: Myth and legend building... J. Campbell would be proud. 
 If here weren't so DEAD, that is...
Sedate nods in agreement with Visual_Mark.
Visual_Mark smirks.
You say, "Back and to the left..."
Visual_Mark has cranked the rumor mill good and hard...
With a puff of steam and perfume, the Rumor Mill cranks out :
Gina and Phydeaux spend lots of time together in locked rooms.
Sedate [to Smack]: so..who cares about truth huh?
Smack says, " not I"
Sedate doesnt.
Smack shrugs.
Sedate says, "There oyu go, personal truth is all that is important..."
Sedate is abou to engage in his first real cover-up...aya!!!!!
Lazarus says, "plausible deniability"
Sedate says, "I'm excited now..."
Smack [to Sedate]: given the oppurtunity I will contest your lies...
Smack [to Sedate]: I think you have lost all credibility...
Lazarus [to Sedate]: try to work the phrase 'I don't exactly recall...' into
 conversation more often.
Sedate [to Smack]: thats why I hope to @newt you.
Sedate [to Smack]: oh this is so much fun tho...
You say, "Geez, this is wack."
Smack [to Sedate]: well then I will come on as a guest...
Sedate says, "Actually y'kow......"
Sedate says, "I will kick all the wizards off and be the head dictator....."
Smack [to you]: can you stand by and watch this travest of history, people
 will call YOU a liar, for contesting Sedate's version of the "truth"
Sedate says, "I hate all the wizards they are geeks."
Smack [to Sedate]: that sounds like the plan
Sedate says, "I will kill the MOO, and destroy it..."
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: You bet I got your draft card... -Paris
You say, "Unless you don't give a FUCK to be free."
Smack [to you]: uh, ya..
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Picked up 'Guerrila Funk' yet?
Visual_Mark grins at Smack.
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: see if this capture gets around it will be too
 ludacriss to be believed...
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: no I have no money so I am veyr new anything less.
Smack says, " what?"
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Shit.
Sedate [to Smack]: I am so broke...or else I'd come down...
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: And kick your ass personally.
Visual_Mark smirks.
Sedate [to Smack]: would oyu give up sandy for a MOO girl?
Smack [to Sedate]: lame excuse...
Smack [to Sedate]: MOO girl?
Sedate [to Smack]: well yeah, but legitimate.
Smack nods.
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: They will believe what they want, regardless of any
 'proof'...
Sedate nods in agreement with Visual_Mark.
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: I noticed that, people like to hear what they want to
 hear...
Smack says, " maybe I should have been more populistic... expounded a bit on
 my vision for the MOO..."
Sedate nods in agreement with Smack.
Sedate [to Smack]: oh well, there's always next time...
Smack says, " oh well. lesson learned, yes, next time..."
Sedate [to Smack]: I'm sure I will give oyu a bit some other time.
Smack [to Sedate]: it will be pointless then...
Lazarus [to Sedate]: to make them all good People's Front of Judeans?
Smack [to Lazarus (may have been bugged by Ashley)]: promise them wiz bits...
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Say, we converted the People's Front to Temple of
 Sedate...
You say, "Irony at work!"
Visual_Mark snickers under its breath.
Lazarus [to Visual_Mark]: I thought it was the Judean People's Front now...
 damn.
Smack [to you]: when you think that file will be ready>
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Sedate's Front of Albatross Feeding.
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: I want it too, post it to gridpoint.
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: A while, why?
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Good idea.
Sedate nods in agreement with Visual_Mark.
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: As in an hour or so...
Smack [to you]: just wondering, I havent got gridpoint in a LONG time...
A cute little stuffed tiger jumps up into Lazarus's face, announces cherubus
 sent him, and smothers him with little tiger kisses.  Then he runs away.
You say, "Depending on how much gabbing I do..."
to smack I unsubbe
Sedate [to Smack]: no?
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: I unsubbed you when you changed accts...
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Resub or I can resub you.
Sedate [to Smack]: there was huge traffic today...
Smack nods.
You see a faint shimmering force wrapping itself around Lazarus (may have been
 bugged by Ashley) and kicking him in the balls.
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Yeah, a real surprise.
Sedate laughs!
Visual_Mark smirks.
Lazarus [to Visual_Mark]: call it The Temple of Sedate on the Lost continent
 of Atlantis and make the symbol of the republic a pyramid with an eye at the
 top?  Too absurd?  Too surrealistic?
You say, "It's phuckin dead."
Smack [to you]: I dunno, if its good traffic yes, if not, no, it was spamm
 before.,..
A cute little stuffed tiger comes out of nowhere, climbs up your shoulder, and
 proceeds to sit in your face.
Tiger wraps his paws around you and cuddles your face, and lets you know
 (tigers don't speak) that he is from cherubus.
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: Naw...
Sedate [to Visual_Mark]: I liked it, in fact I'mm gonna post more often...I'm
 surprised steve spoke tome, I'm still gaged by him here..
Tiger finally releases his hold and hops down from your face, then wanders off.
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Eh, on 2nd thought, forget it.
Smack says, " is sabat on the that list?"
cherubus sees: Visual_Mark smirks. Hiya hiya.
Visual_Mark nods in agreement with Smack.
Sedate nods in agreement with Smack.
You say, "So is AEB."
Smack says, " he is still around them?"
You say, "So is Rivit."
Visual_Mark grins.
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: He was on earlier today.
Sedate says, "ohh mebbe she can post diry chef letters."
Smack says, " cooll"
Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: Feh.
Smack says, "  I dont want to be on a list with rivit, but go ahead and sub
 me..."
Lazarus [to Visual_Mark]: gridpoint is like the soft white under-belly button
 of the entire MOOniverse...
Sedate is surrounded by a warm golden glow..
The glow wraps itself around Sedate with warmth and affection..
Sedate sighs wistfully, as the glow fades..
You see a faint shimmering force wrapping itself around Sedate and kicking
 them in the balls.
Sedate smiles.
Lazarus . o O ( some people need more cybersex here... )
Lazarus smirks.
Visual_Mark [to Lazarus]: What?
Visual_Mark grins.
a small cherub flies up to you, grinning mischievously, and kisses you on the
 forehead......it leaves you with this note from cherubus
It pages, "nighty night!"
Smack [to Sedate]: that was a new one...
Lazarus [to Visual_Mark]: metaphors... just play along.
Sedate [to Smack]: uh huh, so's this...
You hear what sounds like burglars from somewhere...
Visual_Mark nods in agreement with Lazarus.
All of a sudden someone jumps out of the closet and yells, BOO!
Oh look, its Sedate you just shot him.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Sedate laughs!
You say, "Uh."
You say, "HUH-HUH-HUH."
Smack says, " wow, how cool..."
The strains of a lute and a pipe sound. The sky turns all the colors of a
 peacock's tail. You suddenly smell the scent of sweet incense as cherubus
 arrives on a tiny, nebulous cloud.
You say, "COOL."
Smack says, " how can I get one of those chief?"
Visual_Mark [to cherubus]: Heya.
Sedate says, "You guys didn't hear about the girl in luoisianna who did that?
 her dad shot her in the neck with his 357 magnum hollow point bullets."
cherubus curtsies to Smack.
Sedate kisses cherubus lightly on the cheek.
cherubus curtsies to Visual_Mark.
cherubus says, "hi."
Smack waves.
Visual_Mark [to cherbu]: A warning to anyone still in command...
Visual_Mark grins.
Lazarus stands up from the floor.
cherubus [to Sedate]: when she said,Boo?
Visual_Mark hugs cherubus with a warm and loving embrace.
Lazarus sits on the ceiling.
cherubus tilts forward to give Lazarus (may have been bugged by Ashley) a
 light peck on the cheek.
cherubus [to Lazarus]: i didnt see you!
cherubus [to Visual_Mark]: a warning?
Sedate [to cherubus]: uh huh, she pretended to be a buglar..and jumped out of
 the closet and shrieked BOO, BAM!!!

Visual_Mark smirks.
Lazarus crawls over and sits in the chandelier.
Sedate [to Smack]: why not its an gret verb, excellently written.

Visual_Mark [to Sedate]: How the fuck should I know?
Visual_Mark [to Smack]: Eh?

Smack [to Sedate]: good night sweet prince...
cherubus waves goodnight!
Smack waves.
Lazarus [to Smack]: a line from We're not gonna take it by the Who?  Cryptic. 
 Downright diabolicly coptic.
Sedate kisses Smack lightly on the cheek.
cherubus says, "bye!"
cherubus goes home.
Sedate says, "bye Smack."
Smack has disconnected.
< disconnected: cherubus and Smack. Total: 20 >
Sedate says, "YAY lemme slag him now....."
Sedate laughs!

Sedate goes home.
Lazarus says, "cherubus and Smack off fo a liason?"

Lazarus (#4552) is listening.
Lazarus smirks.
Visual_Mark shrugs its shoulders.
You say, "Guess it's over...?"
< disconnected: Sedate. Total: 19 >
Visual_Mark grins.
Lazarus says, "well, I'm even more in the dark... nothing new - and my chick

You say, "Yep."
Lazarus drops Harley Hog.
Visual_Mark grins.
Lazarus climbs onto the Harley Hog!
Home is where you hang your hat.
Slack Emporium
Among the trash you spot an empty Frosted Flakes box, some half-empty Jolt
bottles, back issues of Spy Magazine and Film Threat, a stack of scratched
CDs, some empty Zinger boxes, an empty Quick canister, and a faded cardboard
cut-out of J.R. 'Bob' Dobbs. A small door is on the south wall.
There's a huge, towering, one-way door to The Pit on the north wall.

There is a banana chair here and some beanbag chairs tossed in the corner.
You see an old Star Wars lunch pail, Albatross Hideaway, Iron Maiden, VNJ, and
 Bun Warming Machine here.
