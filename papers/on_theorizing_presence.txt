Presence is the experience of being engaged by the representations of
a virtual world (Lombard and Ditton 1997, Lombard 2000a). Most research on
presence has focused on technologies that use a variety of sensory inputs
(e.g., visual, auditory, haptic) to create a simulacrum of a real environment,
a virtual reality (VR) that mimics perceptions in the physical world (cf.
Biocca 1997, Heeter 1995, Kim and Biocca 1997, Lombard and Ditton 1997,
Lombard 2000b, Witmer and Singer 1998). Less attention has been paid to
presence in the context of text-based virtual worlds. This paper presents
a brief overview of theories that identify factors that promote or undermine
a sense of presence in text-based virtual worlds.

In the context of text-based virtual worlds such as MUDs, MOOs, IRC, and
Chats, presence is usefully described as a feeling of getting lost or wrapped
up in the representations of the text--of being involved, absorbed, engaged,
or engrossed in or by them (Lombard 2000a). Immersion is another term that is
used in the literature on presence, but it seems better suited to the kind of
virtual reality afforded by head-mounted displays and data-gloves, in which
participants are surrounded by or submerged in software-generated images, than
to text-based virtual worlds (cf. Schubert et al 1999:270, Slater and Wilbur
1997:604-606).

As Lombard notes (2000b), analysts use different terms to describe a sense of
presence. Similarly, participants use different idioms in talking about their
experience of it. They may say that they are “caught up” in an activity, that
they are “there” or “here” when speaking of a virtual place, or that a virtual
world is “real.” However, from the context of their statements and from their
descriptions of the situations in which they experience presence, it is
evident that participants are referring to their engagement in a virtual world
and to what Lombard (2000a) describes as an “illusion of nonmediation.”

Different theoretical frameworks are relevant in explaining experiences of
presence. Various analysts (e.g., Jacobson 1999, Lea and Spears 1995, Walther
1992, 1996, 1997) argue that individuals engaged in text-based
computer-mediated communication cope with absent or attenuated cues,
ordinarily present in face-to-face interaction, by engaging in processes of
"optimized self-presentation" and "overattribution" (Walther 1996, 1997). In
the former, individuals selectively construct self-images, imagining how they
will appear to others; in the latter, they idealize others, imagining how they
appear. In these processes, people become invested in such presentations and
idealizations. This theoretical perspective recalls Stone's analysis of phone
sex. She writes (1995:93-95):

    The effect of narrowing bandwidth [from offline, physical reality to
    computer-mediated communication, especially text-based CMC] is to engage
    more of the participants' interpretive faculties….Frequently in
    narrow-bandwidth communication the interpretive faculties of one
    participant or another are powerfully, even obsessively, engaged….In phone
    sex, once the signifiers begin to "float" loose from their moorings in
    a particularized physical experience, the most powerful attractor becomes
    the client's idealized fantasy. In this circumstance narrow bandwidth
    becomes a powerful asset, because extremely complex fantasies can be
    generated from a small set of cues. In enacting such fantasies,
    participants draw on a repertoire of cultural codes to construct
    a scenario that compresses large amounts of information into a very small
    space….client and provider mobilize erotic tension by taking advantage of
    lack--filling in missing information with idealized information.

According to reception theorists and other analysts of reading (cf. Barbatsis,
Fegan, and Hansen 1999, Gerrig 1993, Gerrig and Pillow 1998, Iser 1978, Miller
1995, Ochs and Capps 1996, Ryan 1991, 1994, 1999, Segal 1995), participants
become caught up in virtual worlds when they exercise their imagination to
fill narrative and/or descriptive gaps. Moreover, the greater the opportunity
to imaginatively construct a virtual world, the more a sense of presence will
be strengthened. This is the “less is more” view of the factors that promote
the involvement of readers. That is, presence is enhanced when the "glory of
imagined description" (Brann 1991:468; cf. Reed 1991:30) is not undermined.

Although analysts agree about the importance of imagination in facilitating
the experience of presence in the context of textual representations, there
are different views regarding the processes that affect it. One view
emphasizes the “willing suspension of disbelief.” Coleridge (1847:1-2) used
the phrase in his account of “exciting the sympathy” of readers of poetry in
which “the incidents and agents were to be, in part at least, supernatural.”
For him, the act of the “willing suspension of disbelief” enabled readers to
engage with what they otherwise knew were “shadows of imagination.” (The
concept of the “willing suspension of disbelief” plays an important role in
semiotic and sociological theorizing about the construction of and engagement
in various kinds of realities--see Wiley 2000a and 2000b.) Laurel (1991),
a theorist of human-computer interaction, and Ryan (1994, 1999), a literary
theorist, draw on Coleridge in analyzing the sense of presence generated in
interacting with computers and in computer-mediated communication. Ryan writes
(1999:89):

    This idea of suspension of disbelief is the literary-theoretical
    equivalent of the VR concept of immersion. It describes the attitude by
    which the reader brackets out the knowledge that the fictional world is
    the product of language, in order to imagine it as an autonomous reality
    populated by solid objects and embodied individuals.

The suspension of disbelief model suggests how individuals may become engaged
in textual representations, but it does not explain why such engagement fails
or is otherwise limited. Research in cognitive psychology addresses this
issue.

Cognitive psychologists offer a view of the processes underlying both
engagement and disengagement in the context of textual representations.
Gilbert and his colleagues, drawing on Spinozan rather than Cartesian
perspectives, argue that people initially assign a truth value to a mental
representation, subsequently rejecting it only if warranted by rational
assessment. As Gilbert, Krull, and Malone note (1990:601; cf. Gilbert 1991;
Gilbert, Tafarodi, and Malone 1993):

    Baruch Spinoza…suggested that all ideas are accepted (i.e., represented in
    the mind as true) prior to a rational analysis of their veracity, and that
    some ideas are subsequently unaccepted (i.e., represented as false)….In
    short, the mental representation of a proposition or idea has a truth
    value associated with it, and by default this value is true. This default
    value remains unaltered when the idea is subsequently assessed to be true,
    but is changed when the idea is subsequently assessed to be false.

Gerrig (1993; cf. Gerrig and Pillow 1998), in a critique of “toggle” theories,
including Coleridge’s theory of the suspension of disbelief, extends the
Spinozan argument in analyzing people’s engagement with “narrative worlds,”
including the worlds represented in text-based computer-mediated
communication. Like Gilbert and unlike Coleridge, Gerrig argues that readers
are inclined to accept information as valid in the course of comprehension,
disbelieving it only after conscious appraisal warrants otherwise. His theory
assumes that people will believe what they read --"persuasion by fiction is
the default outcome" (Gerrig 1993:227)--until they critically scrutinize such
claims and reject those that are, on inspection, incredible or unwarranted. In
this sense, Gerrig “replaces a ‘willing suspension of disbelief’ with
a ‘willing construction of disbelief’ (1993:230; cf. Gerrig and Pillow
1998:1-2-103). Gerrig's model implies that comparing a fictional world with
a factual one will undermine a sense of presence. Moreover, since people’s
knowledge of or beliefs about the factual world will vary, different people
will accept (and reject) different claims about represented (or virtual)
worlds.

As predicted by the research of Gilbert, Gerrig, and others, presence is
affected when participants compare the textual description of what is imagined
and the reality it simulates. When the real (or offline) referent of a virtual
world is unknown, presence is enhanced (or at least not diminished by
reference to knowledge and/or beliefs about “real life”); when the actual
referent is known, presence is inhibited or undermined, especially when there
is a discrepancy between the image (that which is imagined) and the actual
world it is supposed to resemble (see Jacobson 2001).

If knowing the real world represented by an imaginary one decreases a sense of
presence, knowing participants offline, in real life, increases the sense of
presence. This seems to happen when participants view a virtual world not as
an imaginary one, but, rather, as a medium of communication. They are engaged
not by the textual representation of the faux world, but by interacting with
people they know. This pattern is consistent with the observations of Towell
and Towell (1997; see Jacobson 2001), who report a stronger sense of presence
among MOO participants who knew one another in real life and/or who knew one
another's real names than among those who did not know one another and/or who
used pseudonyms.

The effect of offline knowledge of others holds when people know one another
before they interact online. The effect of meeting people or seeing
photographs of them after having first encountered them online appears to
produce a different outcome (especially when interaction is confined to
cyberspace), one that reinforces the argument that imagination (and
projection) plays a role in creating a sense of presence. This pattern is
consistent with findings about the role of pictures in fostering online
relationships. Walther and his colleagues (2001) found that for people who had
interacted online for a long time before seeing photographs of their virtual
partners, the pictures were disappointing and hindered the maintenance of
intense and engaging relationships, and when people saw photographs of their
partners before they began to work together online, the pictures somewhat
facilitated the development of such experiences. In the case of virtual
partners who formed impressions of one another before seeing photographs,
idealized images did not match reality, and the difference was disappointing.

When a virtual world is viewed as a locus of activity, Csikszentmihalyi's
theory of "flow" explains a sense of presence (1982, 1988; cf. Trevino and
Webster 1992; Webster, Trevino, and Ryan 1993). Conceptualized as a "flow"
experience, presence entails a "merging of action and awareness," during which
a person loses "self-consciousness" and a sense of time, focusing on "the
present, blocking out the past and the future" (Csikszentmihalyi 1982:38-42;
cf. Danet et al 1998, Fontaine 1992, Novak et al. 2000). Flow theory addresses
the experiences people have when participating in activities that are
intrinsically rewarding and in which a person's abilities and skills match the
challenges she or he encounters. Intrinsically rewarding activities are those
in which satisfaction is derived from engaging in "the activity itself, the
pattern, the action, the world it provides" (Csikszentmihalyi 1982:14).
Although such activities provide participants a sense of challenge, people
have to feel they are capable of meeting challenges; otherwise, an imbalance
between challenges (demands) and abilities and skills (resources) will produce
boredom (if the resources exceed the demands) or stress (if the demands exceed
the resources), both of which are said to undermine, rather than enhance,
a sense of absorption. In Csikszentmihalyi's view, activities that induce
a sense of flow include play, exploration, problem-solving, and those of
companionship and friendship--activities that commonly take place in MOO type
virtual worlds (see Jacobson 2001).

Theorizing about presence is found within different disciplines, although the
convergence is largely unnoted, perhaps because practitioners tend to ignore
the relevance of work done outside their own fields. Although theoretical
frameworks in psychology and of literary studies, especially those focusing on
the role of imagination and on flow experiences, each provides a partial
understanding of the experience of presence in text-based environments,
considering them together may contribute to a fuller and more satisfying
explanation.
